##### How Soma Server works

Currently using a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ running on a headless Linux distro that is modified to act as a content server or a web server. The server allows you to deliver educational websites over the HTTP  protocol within your local network. As a result, the school doesn't need to be connected to the internet but the server works just like a WiFi hotspot with the  caveat that only educational websites loaded on the server are visible. The content is available through a web browser.
